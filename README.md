### Welcome

I’m **Jason Scherer**, a senior software engineer and “dark matter” developer — one of those who build the systems many rely on but few ever see. I’m driven by curiosity, constant learning, and the challenge of solving real-world engineering problems. Outside of work, I’m a husband and father of two, always striving to balance family life with my passion for technology.
