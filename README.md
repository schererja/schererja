### Welcome

My name is Jason Scherer. I am a "dark matter" developer mainly with a loving wife and two kids.  With a huge willingness to learn and motivation to deal with development challenges that come daily.

## How do I pay the bills?

During the day, I work a typical 9 to 5 style job at this time at a computer manufacturing company. There we use the following stacks;

- ASP.net
- .net core
- Django
- Python
- MySQL
- SQL Server
- Perl
- Golang
- Linux (Ubuntu)

## Currently working on

At work I'm currently working on a replacement project that deals with testing computer systems with automated tasks.  Right now that project is developed in Perl but is being converted into Python and C#.  Along with this I'm trying to learn and get myself more into Front End and learning more about front end.

## Where can I follow you?
